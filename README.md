# Legal Text Augmentation
This project aims to enhance the dataset of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on fiscal state aid, focusing on improving low-frequency classes for classification tasks. Apply two augmentation strategies:  

1. **Combination of WordNet and GloVe embedding**
2. **Agent-Based Methods using Large Language Models (LLMs)** 

You can access the full project description and methodology [here](Report.pdf).
